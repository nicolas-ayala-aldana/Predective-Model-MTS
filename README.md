1.Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected multiple regions and countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered that primary care, hospitalization and emergency health services are better prepared. This is important to have timely care for patients sick with COVID-19 or other pathologies. In the current research, the dynamics of COVID-19 was studied at the Hospital “Sant Joan de Deu” of Martorell, Spain.<br> 
2.Objective: The aim of this study is to predict the dynamics of COVID-19 with a multivariate time series model in the hospital “Sant Joan de Deu” of Martorell in Catalonia, Spain.<br>
3.Methods: A multivariate time series analysis was performed with a forecast of ten days, and it was compared with the real cases. The data used was from January 1 to April 11, 2021. To assess seasonality, the Dickey-Fuller Test was used. In addition, the Portmanteau Test and the Granger Test were used to assess correlation and causality respectively. Relative Percent Difference was used to assess prediction performance.<br>
4.Results: The number of cases treated at the hospital, hospitalized patients, PCR tests, patient discharge and new cases per day were analyzed. A review was reserved for ten days for the five variables under study using Multivariate Analysis of Temporal Series. The variable with the best performance was hospitalized patients (RPD= 34.45%) and the variable with the worst performance was discharged patients (RPD= 110.60%).<br>
5.Discussion: Data forecasting has become important since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The forecast results are reasonable with few cases per variable in the temporal series of the Hospital “Sant Joan de Deu” of Martorell. Data predictions for COVID-19 could be useful to create prevention strategies in the community.
